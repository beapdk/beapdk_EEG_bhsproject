# beapdk_EEG_bhsproject
EEG processing project tbd

## Summary
Abnormal patterns of brain oscillatory activity have been identified previously with Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Among the known brain oscillations, alpha band (8-12 Hz) has been considered as a potential biomarker for the condition. This project will aim to explore links between certain key symptoms of ADHD and  This project aimed to explore links betweeen certain symptoms of ADHD and features of amplitude and spectral power of brain oscillations among resting-state data. Results, and links to the different deliverables of the project (coming soon !). Project reports are incorporated in the BrainHack School (BHS) [website](https://school.brainhackmtl.org/project).

## Project definition 

### Background

TO DO

### Tools 

The "project template" project will rely on the following technologies: 
 * [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), to structure the text.
 * The [Hugo website framework](https://gohugo.io) which is used by the BHS website. This makes it possible to easily add the markdown project description to the website. 
 * Adding the project to the website relies on github, through pull requests. 
 * Python

### Data 

At-rest data from ? lab = to be clarified

### Deliverables

At the end of this project, we will have:
 - A Jupyter notebook markdown describing thoroughly all the steps of our project 
 - Python script of main analyses.
 -OSF project management 
 -complete repo access to all commits and changes of our projects
 - Instructions on the website about how to submit a pull request to the [BrainHack School website](https://github.com/BrainhackMTL/school) in order to add the project description to the website. 

## Results 

### Progress overview

The project was swiftly initiated by Beatrice P.DeKoninck, based on the existing template created in 2019 by Tristan Glatard and improved by different students. 

### Tools I learned during this project

 * **Meta-project** P Bellec learned how to do a meta project for the first time, which is developping a framework while using it at the same time. It felt really weird, but somehow quite fun as well. 
 * **Github workflow-** The successful use of this template approach will demonstrate that it is possible to incorporate dozens of students presentation on a website collaboratively over a few weeks. 
 * **Project content** Through the project reports generated using the template, it is possible to learn about what exactly the brainhack school students are working on. 
 
### Results 

#### Deliverable 1: report template

You are currently reading the report template! I will let you judge whether it is useful or not. If you think there is something that could be improved, please do not hesitate to open an issue [here](https://github.com/brainhack-school2020/project_template/issues) and let us know. 

#### Deliverable 2: project gallery

There is not yet a project gallery, as BHS 2020 is the first edition that will incorporate it on the website. You can still check out the [2019 BHS github organization](https://github.com/mtl-brainhack-school-2019)

 
#### Deliverable 3: Instructions 
 
 To be made available soon. 
 
 
## Conclusion and acknowledgement

The BHS team hope you will find this template helpful in documenting your project. Developping this template was a group effort, and benefitted from the feedback and ideas of all BHS students over the years.
